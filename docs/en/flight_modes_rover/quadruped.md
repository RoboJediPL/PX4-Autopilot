# Quadruped Rover Drive Modes

Quadruped rovers support standard manual and autonomous drive modes. Mission and offboard modes command the vehicle through the quadruped controller, which produces leg commands for locomotion.

The following modes are commonly used:

- **Manual/Acro:** Directly control the rover using RC or joystick.
- **Mission:** Follow a predefined mission sent from a ground station.
- **Offboard:** Receive velocity or position commands from an external computer.

Return and Hold modes work the same as for other rover types.
