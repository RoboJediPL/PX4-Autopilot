This repository holds the [PX4](http://px4.io) flight control solution for drones, with the main applications located in the [src/modules](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/tree/main/src/modules) directory. It also contains the PX4 Drone Middleware Platform, which provides drivers and middleware to run drones.

PX4 is highly portable, OS-independent and supports Linux, NuttX and MacOS out of the box.

## Releases

Release notes and supporting information for PX4 releases can be found on the [Developer Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/releases/).

## Building a PX4 based drone, rover, boat or robot

The [PX4 User Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/) explains how to assemble [supported vehicles](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/airframes/airframe_reference.html) and fly drones with PX4. See the [forum and chat](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/#getting-help) if you need help!

### Quadruped Build
To build the experimental quadruped firmware for Pixhawk\_4, run:

```bash
make px4_fmu-v5_quadruped
```

Flash the resulting firmware to your Pixhawk 4 to enable the `quadruped_control` module.

The module exposes runtime parameters:
* `QD_MODE` - selects wheel (`0`) or leg (`1`) operation.
* `QD_THR_GAIN` - wheel throttle gain in wheel mode.
* `QD_STR_GAIN` - wheel steering gain in wheel mode.
* `QD_GAIT_FREQ` - gait frequency in leg mode (Hz).
* `QD_GAIT_AMP` - leg rotation amplitude in leg mode (rad).

Joint position and velocity arrays contain 16 elements in the order
`[FL_TM, FL_RM, FL_LM, FL_WM, FR_TM, FR_RM, FR_LM, FR_WM, RL_TM, RL_RM, RL_LM, RL_WM, RR_TM, RR_RM, RR_LM, RR_WM]`.

Run `Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh` once to install the build and formatting dependencies required to
compile the quadruped firmware and run `make check_format`.
The same script installs the Gazebo Harmonic packages (`gz-harmonic`) needed to run
the quadruped simulation. On macOS the packages can be installed using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gz-harmonic
```

Initialize the Gazebo models submodule before running the simulator:

```bash
git submodule update --init Tools/simulation/gz
```

The quadruped model and world files are located under
`Tools/simulation/quadruped`.

To test the quadruped in simulation run:

```bash
PX4_GZ_WORLD=quadruped make px4_sitl gz_quadruped
```

This launches Gazebo with the quadruped model and the wheel encoder plugin.


## Changing Code and Contributing

This [Developer Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/development/development.html) is for software developers who want to modify the flight stack and middleware (e.g. to add new flight modes), hardware integrators who want to support new flight controller boards and peripherals, and anyone who wants to get PX4 working on a new (unsupported) airframe/vehicle.

Developers should read the [Guide for Contributions](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/contribute/).
See the [forum and chat](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/#getting-help) if you need help!


## Weekly Dev Call

The PX4 Dev Team syncs up on a [weekly dev call](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/contribute/).

> **Note** The dev call is open to all interested developers (not just the core dev team). This is a great opportunity to meet the team and contribute to the ongoing development of the platform. It includes a QA session for newcomers. All regular calls are listed in the [Dronecode calendar](https://www.dronecode.org/calendar/).


## Maintenance Team

See the latest list of maintainers on [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS.md) file at the root of the project.

For the latest stats on contributors please see the latest stats for the Dronecode ecosystem in our project dashboard under [LFX Insights](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/dronecode). For information on how to update your profile and affiliations please see the following support link on how to [Complete Your LFX Profile](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/my-profile/complete-your-lfx-profile). Dronecode publishes a yearly snapshot of contributions and achievements on its [website under the Reports section](https://dronecode.org).
